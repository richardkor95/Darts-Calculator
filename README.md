This program will calculate the expected score of a darts throw give the target and standard deviation selected.

 --> The target is set by clicking on the board
 --> The standard deviation is set by a slider 

The program uses an adaptives algorithmus to calculate the probabilitys of each darts segment. 
To get the expected score, the probabilitys are multiplied by the fields score.
